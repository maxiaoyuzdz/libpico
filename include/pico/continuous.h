 * @brief Continuous authentication protocol support
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Once a device has been authenticated, it can offer to remain authenticated
 * on a continuous basis. In this case the verifier and prover will perform a
 * ping-pong message exchange on a regular basis (e.g. once every ten seconds).
 * In the event that the messages fail to arrive or can't be correctly decoded
 * (e.g. the decryption fails) then the authenticated session closes. In this
 * way the user can be continuously authenticated based on some characteristic
 * such as being within communication range.
 * 
 * The continuous class provides support for these continuous authentication
 * activities.
