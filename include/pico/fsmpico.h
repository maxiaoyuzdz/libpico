 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Provides a Finite State Machine implementation of the sigma prover half of
 * the SIGMA-I protocol. This is useful for event based network APIs.
 *
 * To get this to work, the developer must implement the following functions:
 *
 * 1. write(data, length, user_data): send data to the server.
 * 2. timeout(time, user_data): wait for the specified time.
 * 3. reconnect(user_data): reconnect to the service.
 * 4. disconnect(user_data): disconnect from the service.
 *
 * Optionally the developer should also implement the following functions:
 *
 * 5. error(user_data): act on the fact an error occurred.
 * 6. authenticated(status, user_data): act on a successful authentication.
 * 7. sessionEnded(user_data): act on the continuous auth session ending.
 * 8. statusUpdate(state, user_data): notification that the state machine state
 *                                    has changed.
 * The write(), disconnect() and listen() functions relate to network activity.
 * In addition to these, the developer must also *call* the following functions
 * at when the following events occur:
 *
 * 9. fsmpico_read(): when data arrives on the network.
 * 10. fsmpico_connected(): when a new Pico connects.
 * 11. fsmpicp_disconnected(): when the Pico disconnects.
 * 12. fsmpico_timeout(): when a previously requested the timeout occurs.
 *
 * The semantics for most of these should be obvious. One subtlety is that only
 * one timeout should be in play at a time. If the FSM requests a timeout when
 * another is already active, the FSM expects the previous timeout to be
 * overridden (that is, it should either be cancelled, or extended based on the
 * new timeout request).
 *
 * To use the FSM, and having established the above, the developer can then
 * perform an authentication by first connecting to a service on the channel
 * the service requested (e.g. established by scanning a QR code) then call
 * fsmpico_start(). If the authentication is to be aborted after having been
 * started (and assuming it didn't already fininsh naturally as part of the
 * process), a call to fsmpico_stop() will abort it.
