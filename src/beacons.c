 * @brief Store Bluetooth MAC info for sending beacons
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * When using Pico with Bluetooth Classic, beacons are periodically sent out
 * to all of the devices that have previously paired with Pico. To do this,
 * a file `bluetooth.txt` is stored containing a list of MAC addresses to send
 * these beacons to.
 *
 * This file contains functions for managing this list of MACs, as well as
 * importing them from file and exporting them out again. The code manages
 * a linked list of devices, along with assoicated data (e.g. the
 * commitment of the user associated with the device). This allows beacons to
 * be sent out to some or all devices depending on what's needed.
 *
