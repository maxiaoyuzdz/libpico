 * @brief Useful debug functionality
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * The debug interface provides some methods for instrumenting memory 
 * management (malloc, calloc, realloc, free). The PICO_DEBUG define
 * can be used to turn on and off this functionality. When turned off
 * the instrumentation is completely removed from the compiled library.
