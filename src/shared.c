 * @brief Shared data and secrets needed for SIGMA-I protocol
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * The Shared class encapsulates all of the shared data and secrets needed to
 * perform the SIGMA-I protocol. For example, identity keys, ephemeral keys,
 * nonces and shared generates secrets.
 *
 * Some of the contents are provided at creation (e.g. the service identity
 * key, whereas others are added as the protocol progresses.
