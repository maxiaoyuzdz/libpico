 * @brief Manage user details and their keys
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * The Users class manages a list of users and their public keys. This list of
 * users can be provided to the sigmaverifier to represent a list of authorized
 * users. Only Pico's authenticating using private keys matching the public
 * keys in the list will generate a positive result when authenticating.
 *
 * The list of users can be imported/exported to file.
